      <h1>APRN</h1>
      <div>
        <h1>Standards of Practice for Nurse Practitioners</h1>
        <h2>I. Qualifications</h2>
        <p>
          Nurse practitioners (NPs) are licensed, independent practitioners who
          practice autonomously and in coordination with health care
          professionals and other individuals. They provide primary and
          specialty care in a variety of ambulatory, acute and long-term care
          settings. NPs are registered nurses with specialized, advanced
          education and clinical practice competency to provide health care for
          diverse populations. Master’s, post-master’s or doctoral preparation
          and national board certification are required for entry-level
          practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The NP role is consistent with the APRN Consensus Model, practicing in
          the population foci of Family/Individual Across Lifespan, Pediatrics,
          Women’s Health/Gender Related, Adult-Gerontology, Neonatal and
          Psychiatric Mental Health. NP scope of practice is not
          setting-specific and is based on the needs of the patient. The
          education, certification and licensure of an individual must be
          congruent in terms of role and population foci. Advanced practice
          registered nurses (APRNs), including NPs, may specialize, but they
          cannot be licensed solely within a specialty area. In addition,
          specialties can provide depth in one’s practice within the established
          population foci. Education and assessment strategies for specialty
          areas will be developed by the nursing profession, i.e., nursing
          organizations and special interest groups. Education for a specialty
          can occur concurrently with the APRN education required for licensure
          or through post-graduate education. Competence at the specialty level
          will not be assessed or regulated by boards of nursing, but rather, by
          professional organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to their clinical role, NPs may serve as health care
          researchers, interdisciplinary consultants and patient advocates. NPs
          provide a wide range of health care services, including the diagnosis
          and management of acute, chronic and complex health problems; health
          promotion; disease prevention; health education; and counseling to
          individuals, families, groups and communities.
        </p>
        <h2>II. Process of Care</h2>
        <p>
          NPs blend the scientific process, current evidence and national
          standards of care with a holistic approach to manage patient care and
          foster professional practice. This process includes the following
          components.
        </p>
        <h2>A. Assessment of health status.</h2>

            history.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performing a thorough physical examination based on age and history.

          <li>
            Formulating a differential diagnosis based on the history, physical
            examination and diagnostic test results and information.

          <li>
            Prescribing or ordering appropriate necessary pharmacologic and
            non-pharmacologic interventions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developing a patient education plan that considers the patient’s
            health literacy, competencies and learning needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ordering consultations or referrals based on evidence and standards
            of professional care and shared decisions with the patient and

        </ul>

        <h2>E. Follow-up and evaluation of the patient status.</h2>
        <h3>The NP maintains a process for systematic follow-up by:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Determining the effectiveness of the plan of care with documentation
            of patient care outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reassessing and modifying the plan with the patient and family as
            necessary to achieve health outcomes and patient goals.
